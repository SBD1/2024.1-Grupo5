The entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entity-relationship model (ERM), used to describe entities, their attributes and the relationships between them in a business domain. Entities, represented by rectangles, are objects with unique characteristics - people, objects, entities, etc - from the real world. Attributes, represented by ellipses, are properties of entities. Relationships, represented by diamonds, are associations between entities. In general, the ERD represents the structure that makes up an application's database.
